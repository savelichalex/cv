          The company itself develops a blockchain Everscale, and our team provide a client
          (in blockchains they call it a wallet usually, though it's more than just a simple wallet).
          The app is built for iOS, Android and web, from almost identical codebase (Code sharing is more than 90\% across all platforms).
          I mostly work on UI and performance issues.
          Whenever we had to overcome out-of-box limitations of RN 
          I was the person to resolve that issues due to deep expertise in RN internals.

          At some point I became a lead developer for design system - an internal product for our developers,
          that it's a set of components compliant with our design.
          It helps to build quality interfaces, that doesn't require from all developers to have a deep understanding of RN internals.
