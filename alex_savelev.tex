          As a member of a mobile engineering team, 
          I actively participated in the implementation of product experiments. 
          Our team had a strong focus on metrics, which drove our fast-paced and 
          highly experimental approach. 
          My responsibilities encompassed the entire project cycle, 
          starting from clarifying ideas with the product team, 
          to executing the implementation, and collaborating with the QA team to 
          ensure stability post-implementation. This routine formed an integral part of my daily work.

          Some notable contributions I made to the app include:
          - Redesigning the main page, incorporating cards for episodes and other sections.\hfill \break
          - Participating in various aspects of the onboarding process, including past AB tests and non-experimental components.\hfill \break

          I worked on developing the Everscale blockchain client, 
          a multi-platform application designed for iOS, Android, and web. 
          The client, often referred to as a wallet in the blockchain industry, 
          offers more than just basic wallet functionality. 
          My primary focus was on improving the user interface and addressing 
          performance-related concerns. With a codebase shared across all platforms, 
          exceeding 90\% similarity, I leveraged my extensive knowledge of React Native 
          internals to overcome any out-of-the-box limitations and successfully resolve related issues.

          an internal product aimed at providing developers with a set of 
          components that align with our design standards. 
          This system greatly simplifies the process of creating high-quality interfaces, 
          eliminating the need for every developer to possess an in-depth understanding of React Native internals.
