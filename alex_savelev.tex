        {
          Joined Molecula at the earliest stage, when there was no frontend at all — no codebase, 
          no infrastructure, no production app. I took full ownership of building the MVP from the 
          ground up: picked the stack, set up deployments and infrastructure (via Terraform and Cloudflare), 
          and built the entire client-facing app solo.
          \hfill \break
          \hfill \break
          Worked closely with the designer and stakeholders to figure out what we were building — often shaping 
          the feature scope and filling in gaps myself to keep things moving.
          \hfill \break
          \hfill \break
          After the MVP, I followed through on both the public marketing site and 
          the next version of the app, again taking each project from zero to production.

        {
          Took a break from company work to explore entrepreneurship. 
          Built a mobile app startup from scratch — handled everything from product design 
          to implementation and deployment. 
          While the app itself didn't take off (classic early-stage founder mistakes, especially around validation), 
          it was a major learning experience in product thinking, decision-making under uncertainty, 
          and technical ownership across the entire stack.
          \hfill \break
          \hfill \break
          Also teamed up with my wife to build a website for her online courses — took care of the frontend, 
          payment integration, and deployment. That project reached it's audience and turned out to be a small but clear success.

        {}{}{}
        {ReactNative, TypeScript, Objective-C, Java}
        {
          Joined a team with a strong experimentation culture, where product decisions were heavily 
          driven by data and iteration. It was the first time I truly experienced what it means to 
          own a feature end-to-end — from idea shaping to final delivery — while working closely with product managers, designers, and QA.
          \hfill \break
          \hfill \break
          This role taught me how to navigate uncertainty, clarify requirements early, and 
          stay accountable through fast-paced, collaborative cycles.

        {ReactNative, TypeScript, Objective-C, Java}
        {
          Joined a product-focused company where I shifted from just building features to 
          thinking holistically about the product. My goal was to make a real impact — not 
          only by improving UI and performance, but also by understanding how users 
          interacted with the app and what we could improve.
          \hfill \break
          \hfill \break
          Worked on Ever Surf, a cross-platform Everscale blockchain client (iOS, Android, Web). 
          With over 90\% shared codebase between mobile and web, I often dived into React Native 
          internals to work around platform limitations and ship quality updates.

        {
          Also initiated and led the development of an internal Design System—a project 
          I was passionate about to bring consistency and efficiency to UI development. 
          However, I later realized that the design system introduced friction for 
          fast-paced experimentation; for example, our PM hired a dedicated developer 
          just to handle rapid landing page experiments because changes in the design 
          system slowed down that process. This experience taught me the importance 
          of balancing structure with agility in product teams.
